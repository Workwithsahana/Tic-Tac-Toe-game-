# Tic-Tac-Toe-game-


Developed a web-based Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project involved creating a user-friendly interface and implementing game logic for a classic two-player game.

Key Features:

Interactive Game Board: Created a 3x3 grid using HTML and CSS for a clean and responsive design.
User Interface: Implemented a dynamic game status display to show which player's turn it is and announce the winner.
Game Logic: Utilized JavaScript to handle player turns, check for winning combinations, and determine game outcomes (win, lose, or draw).
Reset Functionality: Added a reset button to allow users to restart the game at any time.
Technologies Used:

HTML: Structured the layout of the game board and interface elements.
CSS: Styled the game board and UI to ensure a consistent and visually appealing user experience.
JavaScript: Developed the game logic, including event handling, state management, and DOM manipulation.
